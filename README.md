# SnakeGame

The Snake Game, a classic, has been developed using Processing 4 for a college project presentation. 
This simple game was created by Gabriel de Campos and Thomas Jefferson.

# To play the game, follow these instructions:

1. Start the game by pressing the "A" key or clicking on the "START" button in the menu.
2. Control the Snake's movement using the arrow keys on your keyboard: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Guide the Snake towards the food to eat and grow.
3. As you eat the food, the Snake will grow in length. Be careful not to collide with the walls or the Snake's own body, as it will result in a game over.
4. Every 50 points you accumulate, the game's speed will increase, making it more challenging to navigate.
5. If you want to increase the Snake's speed manually, press the "S" key. However, be cautious not to reduce the speed to zero, as it may crash the game.
6. For debugging purposes, you can press the "D" key to activate the Debug mode, which will display helpful information during game development.
7. If you want to enable Cheat Mode, press the "C" key. In this mode, the Snake will not die, allowing you to play without worrying about collisions. To disable Cheat Mode, press the "C" key again.
8. Enjoy playing the Snake Game and aim for a high score!

Remember, the goal is to eat food, avoid collisions, and survive as long as possible while collecting points. Have fun!
